# graph-algorithms

<br>

A project I did analyzing the results of graph algorithms on different sized Barabasi-Albert graphs. Check out the report [here](graph-algorithms.pdf).

Here is a gif demonstrating the differences between depth first search and breadth first search. You can see my implementation of BFS in [code/graph.cpp](code/graph.cpp).
